.SH NAME
ifcfg-ppp \- interface ppp configuration
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B /etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-*

.B /etc/sysconfig/network/providers/provider*

.SH PPP Interfaces
To setup a PPP interface you need a configuration file ifcfg-ppp<X> (hint: an arbitrary name might be used for ppp device e.g. dsl0 for DSL connection) with the usual network settings. But you must add additional variables:
.TP
.BR PPPMODE\ {pppoe|pppoatm|pptp|isdn|serial|modem}
must be set to one of the following types to identify this interface as a ppp interface:
.RS 7
.PP
.BR "pppoe "\(em
Point-to-Point over Ethernet (PPPoE) device type.
.PP
.BR "pppoatm "\(em
Point-to-Point over Asynchronous Transfer Mode (PPPoATM) device type. Currently NOT SUPPORTED.
.PP
.BR "pptp "\(em
Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP) device type. Currently NOT SUPPORTED.
.PP
.BR "isdn "\(em
Point-to-Point for ISDN connection types. NOT SUPPORTED.
.PP
.BR "serial "\(em
Point-to-Point for general serial connections via fixed line or modem. NOT SUPPORTED.
.PP
.BR "modem "\(em
Point-to-Point for connections using 3G/UMTS modems. NOT SUPPORTED.
.RE

.BR PROVIDER\ [filename]
.RS 7
Variable specifing the filename of a provider configuration file in the /etc/sysconfig/network/providers/
directory. The provider file contains provider specific configuration options.
.PP
.RE

.BR PPPDEBUG\ { true | false }
.RS 7
Enables pppd instance debug mode.
.PP
.RE

.SH PPPoE MODE SPECIFIC OPTIONS
.TP
.BR DEVICE\ [ifname]
.RS 7
Variable specifing the real, subordinate ethernet device interface name to be used to establish PPP connection.
.PP
.RE

.SH PROVIDER FILE CONFIGURATION OPTIONS
.TP
.BR DEFAULTROUTE\ { true | false }
.RS 7
Set a default route in the system routing tables, using the peer as the gateway. The default route is only
set when IPCP negotiation succeeded and automatically removed when PPP connection stops.
The current default route in the routing tables will be replaced with the new default route.

Default: true
.RE

.BR DEMAND\ { true | false }
.RS 7
Initiate the link only when data traffic is present. This option allows the remote IP address to be specified.
The interface is initially pre-configured and enabled for IP traffic, but without connection to the peer.
Upon traffic the connection to the peer happens along with negotiation, authentication, etc.

Default: false
.RE

.BR IDLETIME\ [seconds]
.RS 7
Specifies the time in seconds after which the idle link is disconnected. The link is idle when no data
traffic is being sent or received. For more info please refer to pppd(8).

Default: 600
.RE

.BR AUTODNS\ { true | false }
.RS 7
Obtain the DNS server addresses from the peer. The addresses (if any) are passed to the /etc/ppp/ip-up
script in the environment variables DNS1 and DNS2, and the environment variable USEPEERDNS will be set to 1.
The option requires the MODIFYDNS variable to be set to true in order to take any effect.

Default: true
.RE

.BR DNS1 / DNS2\ [IP-address]
.RS 7
Specify the DNS server addresses to set in the system with lowered preference than the server
provided by the peer, e.g. initiate the connection on dns queries in demand dialing mode,
or as fallback when the peer does not provide any dns servers.
The servers are applied by wicked using the /etc/ppp/{pre-start,post-stop} scripts.
.RE

.BR MODIFYIP/MODIFYIP6\ { true | false }
.RS 7
When user specified local and/or remote IP addresses for the link, this options allows for modification
of the user addresses with the addresses negotiated with the peer. In order to set the user addresses prior
negotiation with the peer, the DEMAND variable must be set to true.
Without this option, the pppd instance will not accept different values in the IPCP negotiation.

Default: true
.RE

.BR IPADDR\ [IP-address]
.RS 7
IPv4 address to be set as a local IP of the PPP connection.
.RE

.BR REMOTE_IPADDR\ [IP-address]
.RS 7
IPv4 address to be set as a remote IP of the PPP connection.
.RE

.BR IPADDR6\ [local interface identifier]
.RS 7
IPv6 local identifier to be set as a local IP of the PPP connection.
.RE

.BR REMOTE_IPADDR6\ [remote interface identifier]
.RS 7
IPv6 remote identifier to be set as a remote IP of the PPP connection.
.RE

.BR MULTILINK\ { true | false }
.RS 7
Enables the PPP multilink protocol. If supported by the peer, the link created can become part of a bundle
between the local system and the peer.

Default: false
.RE

.BR ENDPOINT\ [discriminator]
.RS 7
Sets the endpoint discriminator sent by local host to the peer during multilink negotiation. For more
information please refer to the pppd(8).
Must be specified when MULTILINK variable is set to true.
.RE

.BR AUTO_RECONNECT\ { true | false }
.RS 7
Instructs the pppd instance to automatically try to reopen the terminated connection when set to true.
Otherwise the pppd instance exits immidiately after a connection has been made and terminated.
The number of attempts can be specified using MAXFAIL variable.
The delay between the attempts can be specified using AUTO_RECONNECT_DELAY variable.

Default: false
.RE

.BR AUTO_RECONNECT_DELAY\ [seconds]
.RS 7
Specifies the number of seconds of the delay between reconnection attempts when AUTO_RECONNECT variable
is set to true.

Default: 15
.RE

.BR MAXFAIL\ [num]
.RS 7
Specifies the number of reconnection attempts to be made by pppd instance when unable to establish
the connection.

Default: 10
.RE

.BR USERNAME\ [string]
.RS 7
Specifies the user name used for authenticating the local system to the peer.
.RE

.BR PASSWORD\ [string]
.RS 7
Specifies the user password used for authenticating the local system to the peer.
.RE
.RE
