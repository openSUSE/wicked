.SH NAME
.\"
ifrule \- configure routing policy rules
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BI /etc/sysconfig/network/ifrule-\fR<\fIinterface\fR>
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BI /etc/sysconfig/network/ifrule-\fR<\fIinterface\fR>
file is parsed together with the
.BI /etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-\fR<\fIinterface\fR>
file to apply static routing policy rules while setup of the given interface.
.PP

The currently assigned rules can be seen by issuing:
.PP
.RS
.B ip\ -4\ rule\ show ;
.B ip\ -6\ rule\ show
.RE
.PP
.\"
.SH SYNTAX
The files are using a quite similar syntax as the \fBip rule add\fR command,
prepended with a \fBipv4\fR or \fBipv6\fR address family.
The address family can be omitted, when either the \fBfrom\fR or the \fBto\fR
prefix contains an IP address.

Lines beginning with \fB#\fR and \fBblank lines\fR are ignored.

.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
Example rules causing to lookup separate routing tables depending on the
source IP address.
.sp
.nf
.ne 7
ipv4 from 192.168.235.42   table 42
ipv4 from 192.168.156.51   table 51

ipv6 from 2001:DB8:235::42 table 42
ipv6 from 2001:DB8:156::51 table 51
.fi

.PP
Custom table id names can be defined in \fI/etc/iproute2/rt_tables\fR.
.PP
Note: \fInat\fR rules are not supported by current kernels (>2.6) any more.
