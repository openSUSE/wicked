.TH WICKED-CONFIG 5 "16 July 2012
.SH NAME
wicked-config.xml \- wicked configuration file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B @wicked_configdir@/common.xml
.br
.B @wicked_configdir@/server.xml
.br
.B @wicked_configdir@/client.xml
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
These files contain the global configuration options for the \fBwicked\fP
network management service. \fBCommon.xml\fP contains common definitions
that should be used by all applications, whereas \fBclient.xml\fP and
\fBserver.xml\fP contain client- and server-specific configuration data,
respectively.
.PP
The configuration file is an XML document; its root node must be called
\fB<config>\fP.

.SH GENERAL OPTIONS
.\" --------------------------------------------------------
.SS Common pathnames
.TP
.B piddir
This element specifies the directory used to write pid files.
.IP
The \fBpath\fP attribute of this element contains the path to this
directory. The optional \fBmode\fP attribute can be used to specify
the permissions of this directory.
.IP
The default is to use \fB@wicked_piddir@\fP, mode \fB0755\fP.
.IP
.nf
.B "  <statedir path=\(dq@wicked_statedir@\(dq mode=\(dq0755\(dq />
.fi
.PP
.TP
.B statedir
This element specifies the location of the directory containing various
files relating to the state of the server. For instance, temporary files
are stored here when starting external programs like \fBpppd\fP(8).
.IP
The \fBpath\fP attribute of this element contains the path to this
directory. The optional \fBmode\fP attribute can be used to specify
the permissions of this directory.
.IP
The default is to use \fB@wicked_statedir@\fP, mode \fB0755\fP.
.IP
.nf
.B "  <statedir path=\(dq@wicked_statedir@\(dq mode=\(dq0755\(dq />
.fi
.PP
.TP
.B storedir
This element specifies the location of the directory containing various
(reboot) persistent data. For instance, the DHCP DUID and lease files
are is stored in this directory.
.IP
The \fBpath\fP attribute of this element contains the path to this
directory. The optional \fBmode\fP attribute can be used to specify
the permissions of this directory.
.IP
The default is to use \fB@wicked_storedir@\fP, mode \fB0755\fP.
.IP
.nf
.B "  <statedir path=\(dq@wicked_storedir@\(dq mode=\(dq0755\(dq />
.fi
.PP
.\" --------------------------------------------------------
.SS DBus service parameters
.TP
.B dbus
This element can be used to override the DBus service name used.
The default is "org.opensuse.Network"
.IP
.nf
.B "  <dbus name=\(dqorg.opensuse.Network\(dq />
.fi
.TP
.B schema
This can be used to override the location of the schema files.
The schema defines the various DBus APIs offered by the server,
and how portions of an interface XML description map to their
arguments. The schema files do not contain user-serviceable parts,
so it's best to leave this option untouched.
.IP
.nf
.B "  <schema name=\(dq@wicked_schemadir@/wicked.xml\(dq />
.fi
.\" --------------------------------------------------------
.SH EXTENSIONS
The functionality of \fBwickedd\fP can be extended in various ways.
All of these extensions are declared in \fBserver.xml\fP, and all
of them follow the same pattern.
.PP
Generally, two extension methods are supported \(em through external
commands and shell scripts, and through shared libraries, respectively.
Not all extension classes support both of these methods, but some do.
.PP
.TP
Shared library extensions
These are specified via a \fB<builtin\fP element, that needs to provide
three attributes: \fBname\fP, \fBlibrary\fP, and \fBsymbol\fP, respectively.
The name serves as an identifier of the extension. The \fBlibrary\fP attribute
specifies the name of the shared library image. If it's found in the global
search path for shared libraries, just the file name is sufficient; otherwise,
the full pathname must be given. The \fBsymbol\fP attribute specifies the
name of a shared symbol in the library that is to be used. The use of this
symbol depends on the extension class.
.IP
An example would look like this:
.IP
.nf
.B "  <builtin name=\(dqbiosdevname\(dq
.B "           library=\(dqlibwicked-biosname.so\(dq
.B "           symbol=\(dqbiosdevname_ns\(dq/>
.fi
.TP
Script extensions
Scripts are specified via the \fB<script>\fP element, which needs to provide
a \fBname\fP attribute and a \fBcommand\fP attribute. Again, the name serves
as an identifier, while the command specifies the command to be invoked.
\fBwicked\fP comes with a (simple) parser for this, which splits up this command
into a argument array which is passed to \fBexecve\fP(2) eventually.
.IP
An example would look like this:
.IP
.nf
.B "  <script name=\(dqinstall\(dq
.B "          command=\(dq@wicked_extensionsdir@/hostname install\(dq/>
.fi
.IP
When defininig script extensions, it is possible to define additional environment
variables that get passed to the script. This mechanism is explained in more
detail below.
.PP
Extensions are always grouped under a parent element. The following configuration
elements can contain extensions:
.\" --------------------------------------------------------
.SS System updaters
These specify extensions for managing files like \fBresolv.conf\fP, or the system
hostname, based on information contained through an address configuration protocol
like DHCP. The configuration element must have a \fBname\fP attribute that specifies
the system service to configure, and include extensions for backing up the current
configuration, for installing new settings, and for restoring the backup.
.PP
The configuration for the resolver might look like this:
.PP
.nf
.B "  <system-updater name="resolver">
.B "    <script name=\(dqbackup\(dq command=\(dq@wicked_extensionsdir@/resolver backup\(dq/>
.B "    <script name=\(dqrestore\(dq command=\(dq@wicked_extensionsdir@/resolver restore\(dq/>
.B "    <script name=\(dqinstall\(dq command=\(dq@wicked_extensionsdir@/resolver install\(dq/>
.B "  </system-updater>
.fi
.PP
Currently, \fBwicked\fP supports system updaters for \fBresolver\fP, and \fBhostname\fP,
with the \fBhostname\fP updater still to be developed.
.PP
This extension class supports shell scripts only.
.\" --------------------------------------------------------
.SS Firmware discovery
Some platforms support iBFT or similar mechanisms to provide the configuration for
a network device through the firmware (so that it's possible to boot off that device).
In order to support these mechanisms, \fBwicked\fP supports extensions to discover such
configuration through firmware discovery extensions.
.PP
.nf
.B "  <netif-firmware-discovery>
.B "    <script name="ibft" command="@wicked_extensionsdir@/ibft" />
.B "  </netif-firmware-discovery>
.fi
.PP
When looking for firmware interface configuration, \fBwicked\fP will invoke all these scripts
in turn and parse their output. Scripts are expected to return XML documents that contain
zero or more \fB<interface>\fP elements describing the configuration.
.PP
This extension class supports shell scripts only.
