.SH NAME
ifcfg-ovs-bridge \- openvswitch bridge configuration
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B /etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-*

.SH CONFIGURATION
To setup an ovs bridge interface you need a configuration file
.I ifcfg-<interface-name>
with the usual network settings. But you must add additional variables:

.TP
.B OVS_BRIDGE <yes|no>
This option must be set to 'yes' to identify this interface as ovs bridge interface.

.TP
.IR \fBOVS_BRIDGE_PORT_DEVICE\fR [ \fIsuffix\fR ]\ <port\ device\ name>
This suffix variable contains the names of port devices to enslave into the bridge,
each port suffix has to be a unique keyword, e.g. _1 .. _N.

.TP
.IR \fBOVS_BRIDGE_VLAN_PARENT\fR\ <parent\ device\ name>
Permits to create a ``fake bridge`` refering to the ``parent bridge`` with implicit
VLAN on the ports of the ``parent bridge``.

.TP
.IR \fBOVS_BRIDGE_VLAN_TAG\fR\ <vlan\ tag>
The 802.1Q VLAN tag or ID used to filter traffic for the ``fake bridge`` on ports
of the ``parent bridge``.

.SH EXAMPLE
Minimal example for a ovs bridge interface on eth2 and eth3, the bridge interface
itself is configured via dhcp:

.I ifcfg-ovsbr0
.nf
	STARTMODE='nfsroot'
	BOOTPROTO='dhcp'
	OVS_BRIDGE='yes'
	OVS_BRIDGE_PORT_DEVICE_2='eth2'
	OVS_BRIDGE_PORT_DEVICE_3='eth3'
.fi

.PP
.B Note:
.I STARTMODE='nfsroot'
.R is recommended if additional ports are created on the bridge
e.g. with \fIovs-vsctl\fR. This start mode prevents the bridge from being teared
down at system shutdown, which would cause all configuration saved in the
openvswitch data base to be lost after rebooting the system. If no such local
configuration is made, e.g. because the bridge is only used for ports being
dynamically added by \fIlibvirt\fR, other start modes can be used as well.
