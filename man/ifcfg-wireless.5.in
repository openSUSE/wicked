.SH NAME
ifcfg-wireless \- wireless LAN network interface configuration
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B /etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-*

.SH GENERAL
Wireless networks need some additional configuration data compared to ethernet
ones. Therefore additional variables for ifcfg files were introduced.
Some wireless variables are not applicable to a single wireless network but are
global to the interface. The description of the variable points this out.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B Mandatory options:
.TP
.B WIRELESS_ESSID
Set the SSID/ESSID (or Network Name - in some products it may also called
Domain ID). The ESSID is used to identify cells which are part of the same
virtual network. If emtpy or set to any the node will connect to the
Access Point with the best signal strength around (in managed operating
mode). For WLANs that make use of WPA (see WIRELESS_AUTH_MODE below)
you need to set your ESSID.
.TP
.B Global wireless options:
.TP
.B WIRELESS_AP_SCANMODE
Defines which SSID scan mode should be used. Mode 0 means the driver
performs the scan. Mode 1 means wpa_supplicant takes care of scanning.  Mode
2 is basically the same as mode 0 but the access point gets chosen by
security policy and SSID. This mode does not support multiple network
settings. Default is "1" for most drivers. Try "0" or "2" if you have
problems associating to your access point. This variable can have no
suffix. This is only used in conjuntion with wpa_supplicant.
.TP
.B WIRELESS_WPA_DRIVER
This variable allows to override the wpa driver name that should be used
by the wpa_supplicant. In most cases "nl80211" (default on openSÃœSE 11.3)
or "wext" (old default) can be used, but there are few exceptions.
.br
The new "nl80211" wpa driver supports wireless regulatory domain, that
can be set in /etc/sysconfig/network/config, WIRELESS_REGULATORY_DOMAIN
variable (global).
.TP
.B Wireless network configuration options:
.TP
.B WIRELESS_AUTH_MODE
Sets authentication mode. The mode depends on the protection technology
being used, WEP or WPA. WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy) is a system to
encrypt wireless network traffic, with an optional authentication on the
basis of the used encryption key. In most cases where WEP is used, open
mode (no authentication at all) is fine. This does not mean that you can
not use WEP encryption. Some networks may require sharedkey authentication.
.br
NOTE: Shared key authentication makes it easier for a potential attacker to
break into your network. Unless you have specific needs for shared key
authentication, use the open mode. As WEP has been proved insecure, WPA
(Wi-Fi Protected Access) was defined to close its security wholes, but not
every hardware supports WPA. In case you want to use WPA-PSK (WPA preshared
key authentication, aka WPA "Home"), set this to psk. In case you want
to use WPA-EAP (WPA with Extensible Authentication Protocol, aka WPA
"Enterprise"), set this to eap. WPA authentication modes are only
possible when WIRELESS_MODE is set to managed.
.TP
.B WIRELESS_MODE
Set the operating mode of the device, which depends on the network topology.
Set to ad-hoc for network composed of only one cell and without Access
Point, managed for network composed of many cells, with roaming or with an
Access Point, master if you want your system act as an Access Point or
synchronisation master. If unset, managed will be used.
.TP
.B WIRELESS_AP
In environments with multiple Access points you may want to define the one
to connect to by entering its MAC address. Format is 6x2 hex digits,
separated by colons, eg 01:02:03:04:05:06.
See also the iwconfig ap option description in the iwconfig(8) manual page.
.br
Note, that some drivers (mac80211 based) may require to set this variable
to a specific access point address, 'any' or 'off' to start scanning for
an appropriate cell, so ifup-wireless sets it to 'any' in Managed and
Ad-Hoc modes when the variable is empty.
.TP
.B WIRELESS_PRIORITY
This variable only makes sense used in conjunction with multiple
networks. If you want to prefer one configured network for over another, set
the respecitve WIRELESS_PRIORITY variable (means, with the same suffix) to a
higher value (integer only). NOTE: This does not work for networks that are
configured with WIRELESS_HIDDEN_SSID="yes" (which is default). For networks
with hidden SSID scanning support the suffix number is important.  The
network with the lowest suffix number gets probed first.
.TP
.B WIRELESS_CHANNEL
With this variable you can define the channel being used. This is only
applicable to ad-hoc and master operating modes. Channels are usually
numbered starting at 1, and you may use iwpriv(8) to get the total number of
channels and list the available frequencies. Depending on regulations, some
frequencies/channels may not be available.
.TP
.B WIRELESS_KEY
You can define up to 4 WEP encryption keys. You can use WEP with open and
sharedkey authentication. The key can be entered in different formats:
Either directly in hex digits, with or without dashes, or in the key's ASCII
representation (prefix s: ), or as a passphrase which will be hashed (prefix
h: ). The amount of hex digits resp. length of the ASCII key depends on the
key size being used: 10 hex digits or 5 ASCII characters for 64 bit keys, 26
hex digits or 6 to 13 ASCII characters for 128 bit keys (see
WIRELESS_KEY_LENGTH below). Examples:
.br
WIRELESS_KEY_0="0123-4567-89"
WIRELESS_KEY_0-"s:hello"
WIRELESS_KEY_0="h:mysecretphrase"
.br
You  can also use 1, 2, or 3 as suffix for multiple key settings. This
is usually not necessary. Leave empty if you do not want WEP.
.TP
.B WIRELESS_DEFAULT_KEY
Sets the default WEP key. The default key is used to encrypt outgoing
packets, incoming ones are decrypted with the key number specified in the
packet. This defaults to 0.
.TP
.B WIRELESS_KEY_LENGTH
Defines the length in bits for all keys used. There are currently 40 and 104
bit keys supported. Sometimes they are also called 64 resp. 128 bits
(depends on whether you count the 24 bit initialization vetor or not).
This variable is only meaningful if you enter the key as passphrase.
.TP
.B WIRELESS_WPA_PROTO
Using this variable you can specify the WPA protocol to be used.
Valid values are WPA and RSN (aka WPA2, can be also used as synonym).
Default is to allow both. When using WIRELESS_AP_SCANMODE 2, this
variable needs to be set, otherwise WPA will be used as fallback.
.TP
.B WIRELESS_WPA_PSK
When using WPA-PSK authentication, you need to specify your preshared key
here. The key is used for authentication and encryption purposes. You can
enter it in hex digits (needs to be exactly 64 digits long) or as passphrase
getting hashed (8 to 63 ASCII characters long).
.TP
.B WIRELESS_CIPHER_PAIRWISE
WPA modes support two different encryption systems, TKIP and
CCMP. This variable defines which to use for unicast communication.
Default is to allow both. In case you want to restrict it to one
protocol, set this variable. When using WIRELESS_AP_SCANMODE 2, this
variable needs to be set, otherwise TKIP will be used as fallback.
.TP
.B WIRELESS_CIPHER_GROUP
WPA modes support two different encryption systems, TKIP and
CCMP. This variable defines which to use for broad-/multicast
communication.  Default is to allow both. In case you want to
restrict it to one protocol, set this variable. When using
WIRELESS_AP_SCANMODE 2, this variable needs to be set, otherwise
TKIP will be used as fallback.
.TP
.B WIRELESS_EAP_MODE
WPA-EAP can use different outer authentication (i.e. TLS tunnel) methods.
Supported value is PEAP (TLS and TTLS not fully implemented yet.
Default is to allow subset TTLS PEAP TLS.
.TP
.B WIRELESS_EAP_AUTH
WPA-EAP can use different inner authentication with TLS tunnel methods.
Supported values are PAP, CHAP, MSCHAP, MSCHAPv2. Default is to allow any.
.TP
.B WIRELESS_WPA_IDENTITY
Needs to be set in conjunction with WPA-EAP. Set to your identity as
configured on the RADIUS server.
.TP
.B WIRELESS_WPA_PASSWORD
Needs to be set in conjunction with WPA-EAP. Set to your password as
configured on the RADIUS server.
.TP
.B WIRELESS_WPA_ANONID
Sets anonymous identity. Default is "anonymous". The anonymous identity is
used with WPA-EAP protocols that support different tunnelled identities
(e.g., TTLS).
.TP
.B WIRELESS_PEAP_VERSION
When using WPA-EAP with PEAP authentication, you can use
this variable to force which PEAP version (0 or 1) to be used.
Default is to allow both.
.TP
.B WIRELESS_PEAP_LABEL
When set to 1 the new label: "client PEAP encryption" can be enforced
to be used during key derivation with version PEAPv1 or newer. Most existing
PEAPv1 implementation tend to use the old label, "client EAP encryption",
which is the default value for wpa_supplicant.
Default value is 0.
.TP
.B WIRELESS_HIDDEN_SSID
Defines whether hidden SSID scan support should be enabled.  Setting this to
"no" can speed up scanning and makes the usage of WIRELESS_PRIORITY
possible. This is only used in conjunction with wpa_supplicant.
.TP
.B WIRELESS_FRAG
Fragmentation allow to split a IP packet in a burst of smaller fragments
transmitted on the medium. In most cases this adds overhead, but in very
noisy environment this reduce the error penalty. Possible values: any
integer (representing the maximum fragment size), auto, fixed, or off.
