# NAME
ifcfg-team - interface team configuration

# SYNOPSIS
`/etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-*`


# Team Interfaces

To setup a team interface you need a configuration file ifcfg-team&lt;X&gt; with
the usual network settings. But you must add additional variables

`TEAM_DEBUG_LEVEL`
:    Level  of  debug  messages. The higher it is the more debug messages will
     be printed.

     Default: **0** (disabled)

`TEAM_NOTIFY_PEERS_COUNT`
:    Number of bursts of unsolicited NAs and gratuitous ARP packets sent
     after port is enabled or disabled. If not set, use teamd default.

`TEAM_NOTIFY_PEERS_INTERVAL`
:    Value is positive number in milliseconds. Specifies an interval between
     bursts of notify-peer packets. If not set, use teamd default.

`TEAM_MCAST_REJOIN_COUNT`
:    Number of bursts of multicast group rejoin requests sent after port is
     enabled or disabled. If not set, use teamd default.

`TEAM_MCAST_REJOIN_INTERVAL`
:    Value is positive number in milliseconds. Specifies an  interval between
     bursts of multicast group rejoin requests. If not set, use teamd default.

`TEAM_RUNNER`
:    must be set to one of the following types to identify this interface as
     a team interface:

    **broadcast** -- Team device transmits packets via all its ports.

    **roundrobin** -- Team device transmits packets via all its ports with
    round-robin method.

    **activebackup** -- Team device monitors ports' link changes and uses
    port with active link to transmit packets.

    **loadbalance** -- Team device transmits packets via all its ports
    performing load balancing (passive or active) with a use of hash functions.
    For passive load balancing only BPF hash function is used. For active load
    balancing runner finds best balance by moving hashes between available
    ports.

    **lacp** -- Implements 802.3ad LACP protocol.


# ACTIVE-BACKUP RUNNER SPECIFIC OPTIONS

`TEAM_AB_HWADDR_POLICY`
:   Determines the hardware addresses assignment for team device instance and
    its ports. This assignment is performed during team device instance creation
    and also for each new port added to the existing instance.
    The followingi modes are available:

    **same_all** -- All ports will always have the same hardware address as the
    associated team device.

    **by_active** -- Team device adopts the hardware address of the currently
    active port. This is useful when the port device is not able to change
    its hardware address.

    **only_active** -- Only the active port adopts the hardware address of the
    team device. The others have their own.

    Default: **same_all**


# LOAD BALANCE RUNNER SPECIFIC OPTIONS

`TEAM_LB_TX_HASH`
:   A list of string elements separated by a comma "`,`"
    which should be used for packet Tx hash computation.
    The following elements are available:

    **eth** -- Uses source and destination MAC addresses.

    **vlan** -- Uses VLAN id.

    **ipv4** -- Uses source and destination IPv4 addresses.

    **ipv6** -- Uses source and destination IPv6 addresses.

    **ip** -- Uses source and destination IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.

    **l3** -- Uses source and destination IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.

    **tcp** -- Uses source and destination TCP ports.

    **udp** -- Uses source and destination UDP ports.

    **sctp** -- Uses source and destination SCTP ports.

    **l4** -- Uses source and destination TCP and UDP and SCTP ports.

`TEAM_LB_TX_BALANCER_NAME`
:   Name of active Tx balancer. Currently only supported value is **basic**.

`TEAM_LB_TX_BALANCER_INTERVAL`
:   Rebalancing interval. To be specified in tenths of a second.

    Default: 50


# LACP RUNNER SPECIFIC OPTIONS

`TEAM_LACP_ACTIVE`
:   Active mode enables sending LACPDU frames through configured link
    periodically.

    Default: **true**

`TEAM_LACP_SYS_PRIO`
:   System priority, value can be 0 - 65535.

    Default: **255**

`TEAM_LACP_FAST_RATE`
:   Fast rate asks link partner to transmit LACPDU frames once per second.
    Otherwise they are sent every 30 seconds.

    Default: **true**

`TEAM_LACP_MIN_PORTS`
:   Minimum number of active ports required to assert carrier in master device.
    Value can be 1 - 255.

    Default: **0**

`TEAM_LACP_SELECT_POLICY`
:   The policy of how the aggregators will be selected. The following are
    available:

    **lacp_prio** -- Aggregator with highest priority according to LACP
    standard will be selected. Aggregator priority is affected by per-port
    option "lacp_prio".

    **lacp_prio_stable** -- Same as previous one, except do not replace
    selected aggregator if it is still usable.

    **bandwidth** -- Select aggregator with highest total bandwidth.

    **count** -- Select aggregator with highest number of ports.

    **port_options** -- Aggregator with highest priority according to per-port
    options **prio** and **sticky** will be selected. This means that the
    aggregator containing the port with the highest priority will be selected
    unless at least one of the ports in the currently selected aggregator is
    sticky.

    Default: **lacp_prio**

`TEAM_LACP_TX_HASH`
:   Same as for loadbalancer runner. Please refer to the section above.

`TEAM_LACP_TX_BALANCER`
:   Same as for loadbalancer runner. Please refer to the section above.

`TEAM_LACP_TX_BALANCER_INTERVAL`
:   Same as for loadbalancer runner. Please refer to the section above.


# LINK WATCH OPTIONS

`TEAM_LINK_WATCH_POLICY`

    Default: **any**

`TEAM_LW_NAME[SUFFIX]`
:   Declares the type name of link watch (with the specified unique watch
    suffix). To declare several link watches, append the same suffix to all

    **ethtool** -- Uses Libteam lib to get port ethtool state changes.

    **arp_ping** -- ARP requests are sent through a port. If an ARP reply is
    received, the link is considered to be up.

    **nsna_ping** -- Similar to the previous, except that it uses IPv6 Neighbor
    Solicitation / Neighbor Advertisement mechanism.
