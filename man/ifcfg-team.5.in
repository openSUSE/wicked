.SH NAME
ifcfg-team \- interface team configuration
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B /etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-*


.SH Team Interfaces
To setup a team interface you need a configuration file ifcfg-team<X> with
the usual network settings. But you must add additional variables
.TP
.BR TEAM_RUNNER
must be set to one of the following types to identify this interface as a team interface:
.RS 7
.PP
.BR "broadcast "\(em
Team device transmits packets via all its ports.
.PP
.BR "roundrobin "\(em
Team device transmits packets via all its ports with round-robin method.
.PP
.BR "activebackup "\(em
Team device monitors ports' link changes and uses port with active link to transmit packets.
.PP
.BR "loadbalance "\(em
Team device transmits packets via all its ports performing load balancing (passive or active) with a use of hash functions. For passive load balancing only BPF hash function is used. For active load balancing runner finds best balance by moving hashes between available ports.

.RE
.SH ACTIVE-BACKUP RUNNER SPECIFIC OPTIONS

.TP
.BR TEAM_AB_HWADDR_POLICY
