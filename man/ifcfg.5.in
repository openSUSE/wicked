.SH NAME
ifcfg \- common elements of network interface configuration
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B /etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-*
.SH FILENAMES AND EXTENSIONS
Configuration filenames that contain the following blacklisted
extensions, will be ignored by wicked:
.TP
.B "~" ".old" ".bak" ".orig" ".scpmbackup" ".rpmnew" ".rpmsave" ".rpmorig"
.SH VARIABLES
The following is a list of variables that can be put in the
configuration file, with an
example in parentheses.
* marks the default.
For the meaning of
.IR suffix ,
see the section
.BR "Multiple addresses" .
.\" How to keep this in sync with the comments in the sysconfig files?
.\" FIXME: allowed values (see also ## Type:)
.\" example in the following text
.\" ---

.TP
.BR STARTMODE\  { manual* | auto | nfsroot | hotplug | off }
Choose when the interface should be set up.
.RS
.PD 0
.TP
.B manual
.br
Interface will be set up if ifup is called manually
.TP
.B auto
.br
Interface will be set up as soon as it is available (and service network was
started). This either happens at boot time when network is starting or via
hotplug when a interface is added to the system (by adding a device or loading
a driver). To be backward compliant
.B onboot\fP,
.B on
and
.B boot
are aliases for
.B auto\fP.
.TP
.B hotplug
.br
Interface will be activated when it is available. Use instead of auto for
devices which may be missed, such as bonding slaves, usb or other plugable
hardware.
.\"TODO: rewrite ifplugd when nanny handles it correctly.
.\".TP
.\".B ifplugd
.\".br
.\"The interface will be controlled from ifplugd. At initial ifup only ifplugd will
.\"be started for this interface. Then if ifplugd detects a link if calls ifup
.\"again which finally sets the interface up. See also variable
.\".B IFPLUGD_PRIORITY
.\"below.
.TP
.B nfsroot
.br
Nearly like
.BR auto ,
but interfaces with this startmode will be not shut down by default.
Use this mode when you use a root filesystem via network or want to avoid
interface shutdown. To force a nfsroot interface down, use either
\fBwicked\ ifdown\ --force\ device-down\ <interface>\fR or
\fBifdown\ <interface>\ -o\ force\fR.
.TP
.B off
.br
Will never be activated.
.PD
.RE
.TP
.B Note:
Hotplugging is available only when \fBwickedd-nanny\fR is enabled.
.br
See \fBwicked-config\fR(5) for instructions how to enable it.
.br
Without nanny, an \fIifup\fR call preforms a one-shot setup.

.\"TODO: reintroduce when ifplugd supported
.\".TP
.\".BR IFPLUGD_PRIORITY
.\"If there multiple interfaces have
.\".B STARTMODE=ifplugd
.\"and a nonzero priority, only one of them will be set up at a time. Every time one
.\"of these interfaces is (un)plugged the interface with highest priority (and
.\"plugged cable) will be set up. Default is IFPLUGD_PRIORITY='0' causing set up as
.\"when the cable is plugged. Note: This is not supported for e.g. bridge interfaces
.\"or bridge ports.

.TP
.BR BOOTPROTO\  { static* | dhcp | dhcp4 | dhcp6 | autoip | dhcp+autoip | 6to4 | none }
Setup protocol. If this variable is empty or missing, it defaults to \fBstatic\fR.
.RS
.PD 0
.TP
.B static
.br
A fixed addresses specified in \fBIPADDR\fR and related variables and static
routing as defined in \fBroutes\fR and \fBifroute-\fR<\fIinterface name\fR>
files is configured. This option does \fInot\fR prevent from getting dynamic IPv6
addresses and routes from Router Advertisements, though.
.TP
.B dhcp4 dhcp6 dhcp
.br
A DHCPv4, DHCPv6 or both clients are started to configure the interface. The
setup is considered successful, when at least one dhcp client configures the
interface. Additionally to the dhcp client configuration, fixed addresses and
routes may also be specified.
.br
.I Note:
.br
Static routes take precedence over routes provides by dhcp or other leases,
that is, a DHCPv4 route with same metrics as a static one will be skipped.
DHCPv6 does not support routing options, an IPv6 Router Advertisement (RA)
is applying them.
.TP
.B autoip dhcp+autoip
.br
may be used for a IPv4 zeroconf setup or as fall back to autoip if dhcp fails.
.TP
.BR 6to4
.br
to set up
.I IPv6
tunnel interfaces running in the "6to4" mode.
.br
See also \fBifcfg-tunnel(5)\fR manual page.
.TP
.br
.B none
.br
For bonding slaves, to skip the link-layer (MTU, MAC address) setup and IP
configuration of the interface in ifup. The bonding script handles the link
layer settings itself at enslave time. See also ifcfg-bonding(5) man page.
Note:  Do not use to just skip the IP setup -- use BOOTPROTO="static"
without any addresses in the IPADDR variables (or routes) instead.
.PD
.RE

.TP
.IR  \fBIPADDR\fR [ suffix ]\ { IPv4 | IPv6 }[ \fB/\fIPREFIXLEN ]
IP address, either IPv4 or IPv6. You may add
.B /<prefixlength>
in both cases and omit
.B NETMASK
or
.B PREFIXLEN.
If you need more then one IP address use this variable multiple times with
different suffixes added. See section
.B Multiple addresses
below. If no address is configured the interface will just be activated (UP).
.TP
.BR PREFIXLEN [ \fIsuffix\fR ]
Number of bits in IPADDR that form the network
address. Alternatively add a prefix-length to
.B IPADDR
or use
.BR NETMASK .
.B PREFIXLEN
is preferred over
.B NETMASK.
but highest priority has a prefix-length added to the IP address in the variable
.B IPADDR.
.TP
.BR NETMASK [ \fIsuffix\fR ]
Network mask. Alternatively add a prefix-length to
.B IPADDR
or use
.BR PREFIXLEN .
This variable is ignored if a prefix-length is specified.
.TP
.BR BROADCAST [ \fIsuffix\fR ]
Network broadcast. If you omit the broadcast address, it will be calculated from
netmask or prefix-length. You can affect the calculation with the variable
.B DEFAULT_BROADCAST
in
.I /etc/sysconfig/network/config.
See the description there.
.\" ---
.TP
.BR REMOTE_IPADDR [ \fIsuffix\fR ]
The remote IP address of a point to point  connection
.TP
.BR LABEL [ \fIsuffix\fR ]
Each address may be tagged with a label  string.   In  order  to preserve
compatibility  with Linux-2.0 net aliases, this string must coincide with the
name of the device or  must  be  prefixed with the device name followed by
colon.
This may be useful with
.B Multiple addresses
(see below).
.TP
.BR SCOPE [ \fIsuffix\fR ]
The scope of the area where this address is valid.
The available scopes are listed in file
.IR "/etc/iproute2/rt_scopes" .
Predefined scope values are:
.in +8
.B global
- the address is globally valid.
.sp
.B site
- (IPv6 only) the address is site local, i.e. it is
valid inside this site.
.sp
.B link
- the address is link local, i.e. it is valid only on this device.
.sp
.B host
- the address is valid only inside this host.
.in -8
.TP
.BR MTU
Set the maximum transfer unit (MTU) for this interface.
.TP
.B LLADDR
Set an individual link layer address (MAC address).
.TP
.B LINK_REQUIRED\ { auto \fR| yes | no\fB }
While a working and connected link is required for further setup
steps, such as bridge STP, link authentication, auto configuration
of the IP address (dhcp, ...) and duplicate IP address detection
(enabled by default), it is required in some cases to continue
the setup without to consider the link detection (carrier), e.g.
in well-known static "router like" setups. You may want to disable
also the duplicate IP detection (see \fBCHECK_DUPLICATE_IP\fR and
the \fBifsysctl(5)\fR manual page).

This variable permits to configure the waiting for link-detection.
When set to \fByes\fR, wicked waits until link has been detected
before it continues with further steps.
When set to \fBno\fR, wicked is permitted to continue earlier,
without to wait for a link in a usable state.
When set to \fBauto\fR (default), an internal logic is applied
causing to use a "no" for tun/tap devices (which require a driver
daemon) and for bridges with enabled STP and without any ports.
In other cases, it behaves as "yes".
.TP
.B LINK_READY_WAIT
This variable configures how long to wait for the link detection
(by the kernel / network card driver) in seconds.
Default is 0, causing to not wait at all if link is not required
or wait infinitely when link is required, so nanny can continue
with the setup when the cable gets connected to the network card
after a while.
Otherwise wicked will wait until the specified number of seconds
and continue with further steps if link is not required or fail
and stop further steps if nanny is not used (see \fBuse-nanny\fR
in \fBwicked-config(5)\fR).
Note, that an ifup call has it's own, independent timeout, which
is limitting the maximal time ifup waits before it has to report
(see global network/config \fBWAIT_FOR_INTERFACES\fR variable).
.TP
.B ETHTOOL_OPTIONS [ \fIsuffix\fR ]
If this variable is not empty, wicked will set these options on an
ethernet type device.
See the
.B ethtool (8)
manual page for available options.
If the option string starts with a '-' (e.g. '-K iface rx on'), then the
second word in the string will be replaced with the current interface name.
Otherwise (e.g. 'autoneg off speed 10') ifup prepends '-s <interface>'.
The optional variable suffix can be used to apply every setting separately,
e.g.:

  ETHTOOL_OPTIONS='autoneg off speed 10'
  ETHTOOL_OPTIONS_gro='-K iface gro off'
  ETHTOOL_OPTIONS_lro='-K iface lro off'

The NIC driver may reject settings as not supported (e.g. '-K iface lro off')
or also when the link is not up.
.TP
.B CHECK_DUPLICATE_IP\ { yes \fR| no\fB }
Whether to detect duplicate IPv4 addresses or not. Set to "no" to disable it.
By default, duplicate IPv4 addresses checks are enabled on ARP capable devices.

The IPv6 duplicate address detection is configured by the accept_dad sysctl
variable (see \fBifsysctl(5)\fR).
Note, that duplicate addresses check requires a connected/usable link and
skipped when it is not (see \fBLINK_REQUIRED\fR).
.TP
.B SEND_GRATUITOUS_ARP\ { auto \fR| yes | no\fB }
When a new IPv4 has been configured on an interface, send a gratuitous ARP
to inform the receivers about the address (trigger arp cache update).
Default is to send gratuitous ARP, when also duplicate IPv4 address check
is enabled and the check were sucessful.
.TP
.B TUNNEL, TUNNEL_*
Using this variable you may set up different tunnels. See
.B ifcfg-tunnel
.BR (5)
manual page.
.TP
.B ETHERDEVICE
Needed only for virtual LANs (802.1q). It contains the real interface to use for the vlan
interface. See
.B ifcfg-vlan
.BR (5)
manual page.
.TP
.B BONDING_MASTER, BONDING_SLAVE_*, BONDING_OPTS, BONDING_MODULE_OPTS
These are used to set up interface bonding. See
.B ifcfg-bonding
.BR (5)
manual page.
.TP
.B IPOIB_MODE
is used to set the infiniband transport mode of an IB device to one of "connected"
(CM - Connected Mode) or "datagram" (UD - Unreliable Datagram).
.TP
.B IPOIB_UMCAST
is used to enable/disable user-multicast for an IB device by setting to "allowed"
or "disallowed".
.TP
.B INTERFACETYPE
In case ifup cannot determine the interface type properly, you may specify the
correct type in this variable to override the behavior and force ifup to handle
the interface differently than it detected from system or config.
Please always open a bug report when it is required to set the type.

.SH GENERAL VARIABLES
.TP
.IR /etc/sysconfig/network/config
.TP
.B WAIT_FOR_INTERFACES
Specifies how log ifup waits for interfaces in seconds by default before it stops
processing and reports the status reached until then. This time may be automatically
increased in case of involved devices which require more time, such as bridge with
enabled STP (IEEE defaults may need up to 50 seconds additionally).

This setting can be overridden by the \fIwicked ifup --timeout\fR option (see the
\fBwicked(8)\fR manual page).
Note: nanny is not affected by this ifup reporting timeout and continues to setup
in background until ifdown or reboot.

.TP
See also the \fB/etc/sysconfig/network/config\fR configuration file and the
\fBnetconfig(8)\fR manual page.

.IR /etc/sysconfig/network/dhcp
.TP
See the \fB/etc/sysconfig/network/dhcp\fR configuration file and the \fBifcfg-dhcp\fR
manual page.


.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
.B Multiple addresses

You can extend the variable name
.B IPADDR
by any string you like. For example
.BR IPADDR_1 ,
.B IPADDR-FOO
or
.BR IPADDRxxx.
Use these variables for your IP addresses.
If you need some additional parameters for these addresses, then just add
the same extension to these variable names:
.B BROADCAST, NETMASK, PREFIXLEN, REMOTE_IPADDR, LABEL, SCOPE, IP_OPTIONS.

Example:
   IPADDR_AAA=1.2.3.4
   NETMASK_AAA=255.0.0.0
   BROADCAST_AAA=1.2.3.55
   IPADDR_BBB=10.10.2.3/16
   LABEL_BBB=BBB
   and so on ...
