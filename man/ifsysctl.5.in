.SH NAME
ifsysctl[-<interface name>] \- per network interface sysctl settings
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fB/etc/sysctl.d/*.conf\fR
.br
\fB/etc/sysctl.conf\fR
.br
\fB/etc/sysconfig/network/ifsysctl\fR
.br
\fB/etc/sysconfig/network/ifsysctl-\fR<\fIinterface\ name\fR>
.SH DESCRIPTION
These files are intended to contain \fBsysctl\fR settings, that
should be applied when a network interface is created. This are
usually interface specific settings, like:

.nf
	net.ipv6.conf.eth0.use_tempaddr = 2
or
	net.ipv4.conf.eth0.rp_filter = 0
.fi

Settings from the global configuration files: \fB/etc/sysctl.d/*.conf\fR,
\fB/etc/sysctl.conf\fR and \fB/etc/sysconfig/network/ifsysctl\fR are applied
for every interface created.

Settings from the \fBifsysctl-\fIinterface\ name\fR file are applied for an
interface, when created, which has the corresponding interface name.

.SH SYNTAX
Wicked writes these settings directly to their corresponding \fB/proc/sys\fR
locations. It supports two separator characters for sysctl keywords: a "\fB.\fR"
in \fIdefault format\fR and a "\fB/\fR" in the \fIalternate format\fR. Therefore,
the syntax is basically the same as is found in the /etc/sysctl.conf file.

Interface names may contain a "\fB.\fR". In the default sysctl format using
a "\fB.\fR" as separator, that is any "\fB.\fR" in the interface name of the
keyword, has to be replaced with a "\fB/\fR". In the alternate sysctl format
with "\fB/\fR" as separator, normal interface names can be used.

\fINote also\fR, that settings with variables in the global sysctl files will be
applied for every interface!
.br
.\" clarify below
Further, files with variables are not compatible to the /etc/sysctl.conf file.

.SH EXAMPLES
Settings for "eth0" and "eth0.1" interfaces
.nf
	# using "." as separator:
	net.ipv6.conf.eth0.use_tempaddr = 2
	net.ipv6.conf.eth0/1.use_tempaddr = 2

	# using "/" as separator:
	net/ipv6/conf/eth0/use_tempaddr = 2
	net/ipv6/conf/eth0.0/use_tempaddr = 2
.fi
