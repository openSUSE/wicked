.SH NAME
ifcfg-macvtap \- MACVTAP interface configuration
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B /etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-*

.SH MACVTAPs
To setup a macvtap interface you need a configuration file that contains at
least the mandatory
.TP
.B MACVTAP_DEVICE
variable with the real interface used for the macvtap virtual interface.

.PP
It may contain the optional

.TP
.B MACVTAP_MODE
variable that may be set to one of the following supported modes: "private", "vepa",
"bridge" and "pass-through/passthru". The default mode is "vepa".

.PP
You may also use the

.TP
.B MACVTAP_FLAG
variable to set the "nopromisc" flag. By default, this flag is not set.

.PP
An ifcfg- file for the interface specified by \fBMACVTAP_DEVICE\fR must
also be provided. In the most basic case, it should at least contain
STARTMODE='auto'.

For use as an interface that is passed to a virtualized guest, manual
configurations of IP and route for the macvtap device on the host are
not needed. See also \fIman\ ifcfg\fR and \fIman\ routes\fR for details.

.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
Sets up \fImacvtap0\fR macvtap interface on top of \fBeth0\fR:

.I ifcfg-macvtap0
.nf
   STARTMODE='auto'
   MACVTAP_DEVICE='\fBeth0\fR'
