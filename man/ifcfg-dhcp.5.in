.SH NAME
ifcfg-dhcp \- common DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 elements of network interface configuration
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B /etc/sysconfig/network/dhcp
.br
.B /etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-*
.SH VARIABLES
The following is a list of DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 related variables that are globally
configured in \fB/etc/sysconfig/network/dhcp\fR. When appropriate, examples are
given in parentheses, and default values will either be explicitly mentioned, or
will be marked by a "*". Please note, that to override any of the variables for
a specific interface, simply redefine the variable in the appropriate ifcfg-
file.
.SH DHVPv4 Specific Variables
.TP
.BR DHCLIENT_SET_HOSTNAME\  { \fIno\fR* | yes }
Should the DHCPv4 client set the hostname?
When it is likely that this would occur during a running X session,
your DISPLAY variable could be screwed up and you won't be able to open
new windows anymore, then this should be "no".
If it happens during booting it won't be a problem and you can
safely say "yes" here. For a roaming notebook with X kept running, "no"
makes more sense.
.TP
.BR DHCLIENT_HOSTNAME_OPTION\  { \fIAUTO\fR* | <a\ host\ name> |\ }
Specifies the hostname option field when DHCPv4 client sends messages.
Some DHCP servers will update nameserver entries (dynamic DNS) to it.
Also, some DHCP servers, notably those used by @Home Networks, require
the hostname option field containing a specific string in the DHCP
messages from clients.
When set to "AUTO", the current hostname from /etc/hostname is sent.
Use this variable to override it with another hostname, or leave it
empty to not send any hostname.
.TP
.BR DHCLIENT_FQDN_ENABLED\ { enabled | disabled | \fIdefault\fR* |\ }
Default is to use the FQDN option, when the DHCLIENT_HOSTNAME_OPTION
variable is set to a full hostname, that is, when it contains a dot.
When DHCLIENT_HOSTNAME_OPTION is set to AUTO, short hostname from
/etc/hostname is send via hostname option 12 (same as SLES-11).
.TP
.BR DHCLIENT_FQDN_UPDATE\ { both | ptr | none |\ }
Request to update A and PTR or only the PTR DNS records using the
hostname specified in the DHCLIENT_HOSTNAME_OPTION variable.
Default is to update \fIboth\fR when hostname is given or \fInone\fR
when hostname is empty and DHCLIENT_FQDN_ENABLED is set to enabled.
.TP
.BR DHCLIENT_FQDN_QUALIFY\ { \fIyes\fR* | no }
Qualify relative sub-domains/hostname in the DHCLIENT_HOSTNAME_OPTION
variable adding a final dot ('foo.bar' -> 'foo.bar.').
When disabled, the DHCP server may append it's update domain the host-
name (e.g. 'foo.bar' -> 'foo.bar.example.net').
.TP
.BR DHCLIENT_FQDN_ENCODE\ { \fIyes\fR* | no }
The FQDN option is encoding hostnames using canonical DNS wire format
by default. This flag permits to enable use of the deprecated ascii
format limited to a single label (short hostname) for compatibility
purposes with draft implementation, which may be unsupported and
cause that a DHCP server ignores the fqdn option requests completely.
.TP
.BR DHCLIENT_SET_DEFAULT_ROUTE\  { yes* | no }
Should the DHCP client set a default route (default Gateway)?
When multiple copies of DHCP clients run, it would make sense that only
one of them does it.
.TP
.BR DHCLIENT_ROUTE_PRIORITY
This option allows to set a metric/priority for DHCPv4 routes. Default is 0.
.TP
.BR DHCLIENT_ROUTE_SET_SRC\ { \fIno\fR* | yes }
When set to yes, the DHCPv4 IP address is set as the preferred source
in DHCPv4 provided routes.
.TP
.BR DHCLIENT_CLIENT_ID
Specifies a client identifier string. By default an id derived from the
hardware address of the network interface is sent as client identifier.
.TP
.BR DHCLIENT_CREATE_CID\ { | rfc4361 | dhcpv6 | dhcp6 | rfc2132 | hwaddr | none | disable }
Overrides the DHCPv4 client-identifier type to use specified in the
wicked-config(5) `create-cid` option, the interface type specific
client-id type and compile time defaults.
Note: e.g. DHCP over Infiniband (IPoIB) mandates an rfc4361 client-id.
.\" .TP
.\" .BR DHCLIENT_VENDOR_CLASS_ID
.\" Specifies the vendor class identifier string. The default is DHCP client
.\" specific.
.TP
.BR DHCLIENT_USER_CLASS_FORMAT\ { string* | rfc3004 }
Specifies the format of the DHCLIENT_USER_CLASS_ID variable.
The DHCPv4 option and it's format is specified by RFC3004 as an array
of class identifiers, but most DHCP clients/servers aren't compliant
with the specification and send/expect a single string without proper
RFC3004 length-value tuple format instead.
When set to "rfc3004" DHCLIENT_USER_CLASS_ID[SUFFIX] permit an RFC
compliant array, otherwise DHCLIENT_USER_CLASS_ID is used as string.
.TP
.BR DHCLIENT_USER_CLASS_ID[SUFFIX]
Specifies the user class identifier [array] to send in dhcp requests.
The DHCLIENT_USER_CLASS_FORMAT variable specified how to interpret it.
.TP
.BR DHCLIENT_REQUEST_OPTION[SUFFIX]
Specifies a space separate list of additional DHCPv4 options to request.
The options can be specified by their code number or by name when defined
as custom dhcp option (see wicked-config.5 man page).
.TP
.BR DHCLIENT_LEASE_TIME
Specifies the lease time (in seconds), that is suggested to the server. Default
is unset which means to use the lease time offered by the server.
.TP
.BR DHCLIENT_USE_LAST_LEASE\  { yes* | no }
This setting controls whether the DHCP client should try to use DHCP settings
provided in its last lease when the DHCP-server is not reachable and
the lease hasn't expired yet.
Set this variable to "no" to disable the fallback to the last lease.
.TP
.BR DHCLIENT_RELEASE_BEFORE_QUIT\  { yes | no* }
Send a DHCPRELEASE to the server (sign off the address)?
This may lead to getting a different address/hostname next time an address
is requested. But some servers require it.
.TP
.BR DHCLIENT_SLEEP
Some interfaces need time to initialize and/or do not report correct status.
Add the latency time in seconds so these can be handled properly. Should
probably set per interface rather than here.
This setting causes a sleep time before DHCP clients are started regardless
of the link status.
Note: RFC 2131 specifies, that the DHCP client should wait a random time
between one and ten seconds to desynchronize the use of DHCP at startup.
We do not use this initial delay to not slow down start/boot time. By default,
this is set to 0.
.TP
.BR DHCLIENT_WAIT_AT_BOOT
The DHCP client will try to get a lease for DHCLIENT_WAIT_AT_BOOT seconds,
then inform the waiting ifup, that it continues in background.
When you increase this time, increase also the WAIT_FOR_INTERFACES variable
e.g. to a value twice as high as the time specified here.
Default is 15 seconds.
.TP
.BR DHCLIENT_TIMEOUT
The DHCP client will stop processing / fail after this time when it does
not get a reply from the DHCP server. Before you set this variable, take a
look at DHCLIENT_WAIT_AT_BOOT allowing to continue in background instead.
Default value is 0.
.TP
.BR DHCLIENT_UPDATE\ {default,none,all,dns,ntp,nis,tz,boot,smb,nds,slp,sip,log}
This variable permits to specify a space separated list of built-in
facility names supported by the dhcp4 client modifying the default
options used in requests and to update system settings (via netconfig).

When empty, default settings configured in wicked-config(5) or built-in
defaults are used. The special "default", "all", and "none" sets enable
to request none, the built-in default set or all supported options,
respectively. A "no-" or "-" in the front of a facility name permit to
remove/disable it from the currently applied set, e.g. "default,-nis"
disables request for nis options.
More specific variables as DHCLIENT_SET_DEFAULT_ROUTE,DHCLIENT_SET_HOSTNAME
or the MTU option have higher precedence.
.TP
.BR DHCLIENT_BROADCAST\ { yes | \fIno\fR* }
Request broadcast responses from dhcp-server.

The default behaviour is to not request broadcast responses for any type
of devices except of Infiniband, where it is enabled by default and not
possible to disable.

.SH DHCPv6 Specific Variables
.TP
.BR DHCLIENT6_MODE\  { auto* | info | managed | prefix }
This option allows to specify the request mode used by the DHCPv6
client when the BOOTPROTO is set to dhcp or dhcp6, and overrides
the "Managed Address Configuration" and the "Other Configuration"
flags provided by the IPv6 router its Router Advertisement (RA)
for the network connected to this interface.
.RS
.PD 0
.TP
.B auto
.br
Follow IPv6 RA flags, remain silent when no RA flags are set.
.TP
.B info
.br
Request other configuration (dns,ntp) only, no IP address.
.TP
.B managed
.br
Request IP address as well as other configuration.
.TP
.B prefix
.br
Request a prefix for delegation, usable also in combination
with auto and managed mode, i.e. auto+prefix or managed+prefix.
.PD
.RE
.TP
.BR DHCLIENT6_RAPID_COMMIT\  { yes* | no }
This option allows the DHCPv6 client to indicate its desire to accept
rapid commit leases using two-packet exchange (solicitation, lease ack)
instead of the four packet (solicitation, offer, request, lease ack).
.TP
.BR DHCLIENT6_PREFIX_HINT\ { prefix/length }
Permits to specify an explicit prefix-length (e.g. ::/56) or a specific
prefix with a length (e.g. 2001:db8::/48), that are sent to the DHCPv6
server as hint when prefix delegation request mode is enabled in the
DHCLIENT6_MODE variable.
.TP
.BR DHCLIENT6_ADDRESS_LENGTH\ { length }
Permits to specify explicit prefix-length to use for the DHCPv6 address,
e.g. 64 to use address as 2001:db8::1/64 or 80 for 2001:db8::1/80.
When 0 or unspecified (default), prefix-length of the smallest on-link
prefix (highest /length number) in the IPv6 router advertisement matching
the address is used or 128 (see also rfc5942).
.TP
.BR DHCLIENT6_SET_HOSTNAME\  { yes | no* }
Should the DHCPv6 client set the hostname?
When it is likely that this would occur during a running X session,
your DISPLAY variable could be screwed up and you won't be able to
open new windows anymore, then this should be "no".
If it happens during booting it won't be a problem and you can
safely say "yes" here. For a roaming notebook with X kept running,
"no" makes more sense.
.TP
.BR DHCLIENT6_HOSTNAME_OPTION\ { \fIAUTO\fR* | <a\ host\ name> |\ }
Specifies the hostname option field when DHCPv6 client sends messages.
Some DHCP servers will update nameserver entries (dynamic DNS) to it.
When set to "AUTO", the current hostname from /etc/hostname is sent.
Use this variable to override it with another hostname, or leave it
empty to not send any hostname.
.TP
.BR DHCLIENT6_FQDN_ENABLED\ { enabled | disabled | \fIdefault\fR* |\ }
Default is to use the FQDN option, when the DHCLIENT6_HOSTNAME_OPTION
variable provides a hostname.
When DHCLIENT6_HOSTNAME_OPTION is set to AUTO, short hostname from the
/etc/hostname file is send (same to SLES-11).
.TP
.BR DHCLIENT6_FQDN_UPDATE\ { both | ptr | none |\ }
Request to update AAAA and PTR or only the PTR DNS records using the
hostname specified in DHCLIENT6_HOSTNAME_OPTION variable.
Default is to update \fIboth\fR when hostname is set or \fInone\fR
when hostname is empty and DHCLIENT6_FQDN_ENABLED is set to enabled.
.TP
.BR DHCLIENT6_FQDN_QUALIFY\ { \fIyes\fR* | no }
Qualify relative sub-domains/hostname in the DHCLIENT6_HOSTNAME_OPTION
variable adding a final dot ('foo.bar' -> 'foo.bar.').
When disabled, the DHCP server may append it's update domain the host-
name (e.g. 'foo.bar' -> 'foo.bar.example.net').
.TP
.BR DHCLIENT6_CLIENT_ID
This option allows to manually specify a client identifier (DUID) as a colon
separated hex byte string for DHCPv6. It disables the default behavior to
maintain the client-id automatically, see wicked-config(5) and `wicked duid --help`
for more details.
.TP
.BR DHCLIENT6_REQUEST_OPTION[SUFFIX]
Specifies a space separate list of additional DHCPv6 options to request.
The options can be specified by their code number or by name when defined
as custom dhcp option (see wicked-config.5 man page).
.TP
.BR DHCLIENT6_LEASE_TIME
 Specifies the preferred lifetime (in seconds) used as T1/renewal
 (1/2 of it) and T1/rebind (4/5 of it) in DHCPv6 IA NA requests.
 Default is to not propose anything but use the times as offered
 by the DHCPv6 server.
.TP
.BR DHCLIENT6_USE_LAST_LEASE\  { yes* | no }
This setting controls whether DHCPv6 client should try to use settings
provided in its last lease when the DHCPv6-server is not reachable and
the lease hasn't expired yet.
Set this variable to "no" to disable the fallback to the last lease.
.TP
.BR DHCLIENT6_REFRESH_LEASE\ {yes,no*}
When ifup is called, the system or wickedd has been restarted or the
client may have moved to a new link (temporary carrier-lost) and there
is a valid lease available, DHCPv6 protocol is using (depending on
IPv6 router RA and DHCLIENT6_MODE variable):
.IP
.nf
- information-request in info mode ("other-config" without IP address)
- rebind message if the lease contains (also) a prefix for delegations
- confirm message if the lease contains an ("managed") IP address
.fi

While information-request and rebind provide "other-config" (dns,ntp
and other options) and extend the lifetimes, a confirm reply provides
only a status (code) whether the lease IP address(es) are still
appropriate to the link.

Enabling this option causes to use rebind instead of a confirm and
thus to refresh lease options and extend the lifetimes.
.TP
.BR DHCLIENT6_RELEASE_BEFORE_QUIT\  { yes | no* }
Send a DHCPv6 RELEASE to the server (sign off the address)?
This may lead to getting a different address/hostname next time an address
is requested. But some servers require it.
.TP
.BR DHCLIENT6_SLEEP
Some interfaces need time to initialize and/or do not report correct status.
By default, DHCPv6 waits until the link-local address (fe80::) is available
and then ~1 second as specified by RFC3315.
This setting allows override to use a non-standsrd initial delay. Default
is 0.
.TP
.BR DHCLIENT6_WAIT_AT_BOOT
The DHCPv6 client will try to get a lease for DHCLIENT6_WAIT_AT_BOOT seconds,
then inform the waiting ifup, that it continues in background.
When you increase this time, increase also the WAIT_FOR_INTERFACES variable
e.g. to a value twice as high as the time specified here.
Default is 15 seconds.
.TP
.BR DHCLIENT6_TIMEOUT
The DHCPv6 client will stop processing / fail after this time when it does
not get a reply from the DHCPv6 server. Before you set this variable, take a
look at DHCLIENT6_WAIT_AT_BOOT allowing to continue in background instead.
.TP
.BR DHCLIENT6_UPDATE\ {default,none,all,dns,ntp,tz,boot,nis,sip}
This variable permits to specify a space separated list of built-in
facility names supported by the dhcp6 client modifying the default
options used in requests and to update system settings (via netconfig).

When empty, default settings configured in wicked-config(5) or built-in
defaults are used. The special "default", "all", and "none" sets enable
to request none, the built-in default set or all supported options,
respectively. A "no-" or "-" in the front of a facility name permit to
remove/disable it from the currently applied set, e.g. "default,-nis"
disables request for nis options.
The more specific variable DHCLIENT6_SET_HOSTNAME has higher precedence.
