.SH NAME
ifcfg-dhcp \- common DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 elements of network interface configuration
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B /etc/sysconfig/network/dhcp
.br
.B /etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-*
.SH VARIABLES
The following is a list of DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 related variables that are globally
configured in \fB/etc/sysconfig/network/dhcp\fR. When appropriate, examples are
given in parentheses, and default values will either be explicity mentioned, or
will be marked by a "*". Please note, that to override any of the variables for
a specific interface, simply redefine the variable in the appropriate ifcfg-
file.
.SH DHVPv4 Specific Variables
.TP
.BR DHCLIENT_SET_HOSTNAME\  { yes | no* }
Should the DHCPv4 client set the hostname?
When it is likely that this would occur during a running X session,
your DISPLAY variable could be screwed up and you won't be able to open
new windows anymore, then this should be "no".
If it happens during booting it won't be a problem and you can
safely say "yes" here. For a roaming notebook with X kept running, "no"
makes more sense.
.TP
.BR DHCLIENT_HOSTNAME_OPTION\  { "AUTO"* | }
Specifies the hostname option field when DHCPv4 client sends messages.
Some DHCP servers will update nameserver entries (dynamic DNS) to it.
Also, some DHCP servers, notably those used by @Home Networks, require
the hostname option field containing a specific string in the DHCP
messages from clients.
When set to "AUTO", the current hostname from /etc/hostname is sent.
Use this variable to override it with another hostname, or leave it
empty to not send any hostname.
.TP
.BR DHCLIENT_SET_DEFAULT_ROUTE\  { yes* | no }
Should the DHCP client set a default route (default Gateway)?
When multiple copies of DHCP clients run, it would make sense that only
one of them does it. 
.TP
.BR DHCLIENT_ROUTE_PRIORITY
This option allows to set a metric/priority for DHCPv4 routes. Default is 0.
.TP
.BR DHCLIENT_CLIENT_ID
Specifies a client identifier string. By default an id derived from the
hardware address of the network interface is sent as client identifier.
.TP
.BR DHCLIENT_VENDOR_CLASS_ID
Specifies the vendor class identifier string. The default is DHCP client
specific.
.TP
.BR DHCLIENT_USER_CLASS_ID
Specifies the user class option as either a rfc3004 formatted identifier list
or a single, non-standard identifier string. The format type must be supplied
as a prefix to the user class id data. If no format, or an invalid format is
specified, the data will be treated as a non-standard identifier string.The
entire set of identifiers supplied must be no longer than 130 characters.
.RS
.PD 0
.TP
.B Examples:
.TP
.B rfc3004:custom-uc1,custom-uc2,...,custom-ucN
.br
Generates a rfc3004 formatted user class option composed of strings custom-uc1...custom-ucN.
.TP
.B string:custom-uc
.br
Generates a non-rfc3004 user class option from string custom-uc.
.PD
.RE
.TP
.BR DHCLIENT_LEASE_TIME
Specifies the lease time (in seconds), that is suggested to the server. Default
is unset which means to use the lease time offered by the server.
.TP
.BR DHCLIENT_USE_LAST_LEASE\  { yes* | no }
This setting controls whether the DHCP client should try to use DHCP settings
provided in its last lease when the DHCP-server is not reachable and
the lease hasn't expired yet.
Set this variable to "no" to disable the fallback to the last lease.
.TP
.BR DHCLIENT_RELEASE_BEFORE_QUIT\  { yes | no* }
Send a DHCPRELEASE to the server (sign off the address)?
This may lead to getting a different address/hostname next time an address
is requested. But some servers require it.
.TP
.BR DHCLIENT_SLEEP
Some interfaces need time to initialize and/or do not report correct status.
Add the latency time in seconds so these can be handled properly. Should
probably set per interface rather than here.
This setting causes a sleep time before DHCP clients are started regardless
of the link status.
Note: RFC 2131 specifies, that the DHCP client should wait a random time
between one and ten seconds to desynchronize the use of DHCP at startup.
We do not use this initial delay to not slow down start/boot time. By default,
this is set to 0.
.TP
.BR DHCLIENT_WAIT_AT_BOOT
The DHCP client will try to get a lease for DHCLIENT_WAIT_AT_BOOT seconds,
then inform the waiting ifup, that it continues in background.
When you increase this time, increase also the WAIT_FOR_INTERFACES variable
e.g. to a value twice as high as the time specified here.
Default is 15 seconds.
.TP
.BR DHCLIENT_TIMEOUT
The DHCP client will stop processing / fail after this time when it does
not get a reply from the DHCP server. Before you set this variable, take a
look at DHCLIENT_WAIT_AT_BOOT allowing to continue in background instead.
Default value is 0.

.SH DHCPv6 Specific Variables
.TP
.BR DHCLIENT6_MODE\  { auto* | info | managed }
This option allows to specify the request mode used by the DHCPv6
client when the BOOTPROTO is set to dhcp or dhcp6, and overrides
the "Managed Address Configuration" and the "Other Configuration"
flags provided by the IPv6 router its Router Advertisement (RA)
for the network connected to this interface.
.RS
.PD 0
.TP
.B auto
.br
Follow RA flags, remain silent when no RA flag is set.
.TP
.B info
.br
Request other configuration (dns,ntp) only, no IP address.
.TP
.B managed
.br
Request IP address as well as other configuration.
.PD
.RE
.TP
.BR DHCLIENT6_RAPID_COMMIT\  { yes* | no }
This option allows the DHCPv6 client to indicate its desire to accept
rapid commit leases using two-packet exchange (solicitation, lease ack)
instead of the four packet (solicitation, offer, request, lease ack).
.TP
.BR DHCLIENT6_SET_HOSTNAME\  { yes | no* }
Should the DHCPv6 client set the hostname?
When it is likely that this would occur during a running X session,
your DISPLAY variable could be screwed up and you won't be able to
open new windows anymore, then this should be "no".
If it happens during booting it won't be a problem and you can
safely say "yes" here. For a roaming notebook with X kept running,
"no" makes more sense.
.TP
.BR DHCLIENT6_HOSTNAME_OPTION\  { "AUTO"* | }
 Specifies the hostname option field when DHCPv6 client sends messages.
 Some DHCP servers will update nameserver entries (dynamic DNS) to it.
 When set to "AUTO", the current hostname from /etc/hostname is sent.
 Use this variable to override it with another hostname, or leave it
 empty to not send any hostname.
.TP
.BR DHCLIENT6_LEASE_TIME
 Specifies the preferred lifetime (in seconds) used as T1/renewal
 (1/2 of it) and T1/rebind (4/5 of it) in DHCPv6 IA NA requests.
 Default is to not propose anything but use the times as offered
 by the DHCPv6 server.
.TP
.BR DHCLIENT6_USE_LAST_LEASE\  { yes* | no }
This setting controls whether DHCPv6 client should try to use settings
provided in its last lease when the DHCPv6-server is not reachable and
the lease hasn't expired yet.
Set this variable to "no" to disable the fallback to the last lease.
.TP
.BR DHCLIENT6_RELEASE_BEFORE_QUIT\  { yes | no* }
Send a DHCPv6 RELEASE to the server (sign off the address)?
This may lead to getting a different address/hostname next time an address
is requested. But some servers require it.
.TP
.BR DHCLIENT6_SLEEP
Some interfaces need time to initialize and/or do not report correct status.
By default, DHCPv6 waits until the link-local address (fe80::) is available
and then ~1 second as specified by RFC3315.
This setting allows override to use a non-standsrd initial delay. Default
is 0.
.TP
.BR DHCLIENT6_WAIT_AT_BOOT
The DHCPv6 client will try to get a lease for DHCLIENT6_WAIT_AT_BOOT seconds,
then inform the waiting ifup, that it continues in background.
When you increase this time, increase also the WAIT_FOR_INTERFACES variable
e.g. to a value twice as high as the time specified here.
Default is 15 seconds.
.TP
.BR DHCLIENT6_TIMEOUT
The DHCPv6 client will stop processing / fail after this time when it does
not get a reply from the DHCPv6 server. Before you set this variable, take a
look at DHCLIENT6_WAIT_AT_BOOT allowing to continue in background instead.
