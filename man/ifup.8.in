.SH NAME
ifup \- start a pre-configured network interface.
.br
ifdown \- stop a (pre-configured) network interface.
.br
ifstatus \- show the state of a (pre-configured) network interface.
.br
ifprobe \- checks if the configuration for the interface has changed

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B if{up,down,status,probe}
.B [
.I <configuration-name>
.B ]
.I <interface>
.B [-o
.I options
.B ]

.SH NOTATION
We use the terms
.B configuration, interface
and
.B device
in a dedicated way. A
.B device
is always a piece of hardware representing a network interface, a PCI or
PCMCIA card or a USB device. An
.B interface
then is the name of the network interface it gets from the kernel, when the
device has been registered. A
.B configuration
is a set of
parameters which can be assigned to an interface like IP addresses or routes.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B ifup
is used to bring up a pre-configured interface for networking. It is usually
invoked by the network script at boot time or by the PCMCIA/hotplug system.
It can also be used to start interfaces manually on the command line.
It activates the link, adds addresses and other parameters and sets up the
routes for an interface.
.br
Former iprenew operation is performed upon each successfull ifup call.
.P
.B ifdown
is used to set down the interface and flush all its addresses. It is possible
to let ifdown check the interface if it is still used before setting it down.
If configured it may then get rid of the using processes or refuse setting it
down. Have a look at
.I /etc/sysconfig/network/config
to enable this feature.
.P
.B ifstatus
checks if the interface and its routes were set up properly.
.P
.B ifprobe
checks if any of the configuration files for this interface have been changed
since the interface is up.
.P
.B <interface>
is the network interface name.
.br
The network interface names of physical network devices are assigned by
the kernel and may be modified by
.BR udev (7)
rules.
.P
.I <configuration-name>
This optional parameter exists for compatibility reasons only and is not used.

.SH OPTIONS
.IP "The following are options to be specified after the -o switch."
.IP debug
Be verbose.
.IP quiet
Silent mode. Feedback only via return code.
.IP force
Applicable to ifdown only. Forces persistent (nfsroot type) interface down.

.SH FILES
.I /sbin/ifup
.RS
The script itself.
.RE
.I /etc/sysconfig/network/config
.RS
General configuration options. See section GENERAL VARIABLES below.
.RE
.I /etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg- <configuration-name>
.RS
The files containing the configuration of the devices.
An example that shows a typical configuration with the name
.BR ifcfg-eth0 :
.nf

IPADDRESS=10.10.11.184
NETMASK=255.255.0.0
BROADCAST=10.10.255.255
STARTMODE=onboot
BOOTPROTO=static

.fi
.RE
.I /etc/sysconfig/network/ifroute- <configuration-name>
.RS
You can specify individual routes for every configuration in these files. See
routes (5) for a detailed description.

.SH GENERAL VARIABLES
There are some general settings in the file
.IR /etc/sysconfig/network/config .
If needed you can also set most of the general variables as an individual variable
in the
.B ifcfg-*
files.
Please see the description of these variables in
.IR /etc/sysconfig/network/config .
.PP
For dhcp there are additional global options in
.IR /etc/sysconfig/network/dhcp .
Also these are described there and can be used individually in
.B ifcfg-*
files.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.B ifstatus
.I interface

wicked generates debug output when called with
.B debug
option set to a particular facility (e.g. all). Please use it, when something wrong is happening.
