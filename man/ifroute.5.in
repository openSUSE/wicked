.TH IFROUTE 5 "May 2014" "sysconfig" "Network configuration"
.\"
.SH NAME
.\"
ifroute \- configure the interface static routing tables
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BI /etc/sysconfig/network/ifroute-\fR<\fIinterface\fR>
.br
.B /etc/sysconfig/network/routes
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BI /etc/sysconfig/network/ifroute-\fR<\fIinterface\fR>
and the
.BI /etc/sysconfig/network/routes
file are parsed together with the
.BI /etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-\fR<\fIinterface\fR>
file to set up static routes for a particular interface.
.PP
The
.B /etc/sysconfig/network/ifroute-\fR<\fIinterface\fR>
file contains routes for the particular interface while the
.B /etc/sysconfig/network/routes
can contain routes for all interfaces.

The currently assigned routes can be seen by issuing:
.PP
.RS
.B /sbin/ip\ -4\ route\ show ;
.B /sbin/ip\ -6\ route\ show
.RE
.PP
which will give the current (main) routing tables.
.\"
.SH Syntax
Both files use the same syntax. The only difference is the interpretation the
interface field in the 4th column.

Lines beginning with
.B #
and
.B blank lines
are ignored. There are 5 columns with special meaning.
Write a dash "-" if you want to omit an entry for a field. If all following
fields in the line are empty too, you can even omit the dash.

The columns are:
.B Destination Gateway Netmask Interface Options

The
.B 1st, Destination
column gives the destination / prefix, written as the IP-address of a host
or as a network in a prefix-length (CIDR notation), e.g.
.B 10.10.0.0/16
for IPv4 or
.B fc00::/7
for IPv6 routes. The heading
.B default
indicates that the route is the default gateway in the same address family
(ipv4 or ipv6) as the gateway. For device routes without a gateway use
explicit 0.0.0.0/0 or ::/0 destinations.

The
.B 2nd, Gateway
column defines the gateway. Write here the regular IP-address of a host which
routes the packets to a remote host or remote network.
You can omit this information for rejecting or device routes using a dash '-'.

The
.B 3rd, Netmask
column is \fIdeprecated\fR and gives the IPv4 netmask of the destination.
For IPv6 routes, the default route or if you were using a prefix-length (CIDR
notation) in the 1st destination column, you can omit it using a dash '-'.

The
.B 4th, Interface
column contains the name of the interface (lo, eth0, eth1, ib0, ...).

If you leave this field empty (using a dash '-'), the result depends on the
file you are using.

In
.B /etc/sysconfig/network/routes
the field is interpreted as no interface information available and the
gateway is examined if it belongs to the same network as a IPADDR in all
(currently parsed) ifcfg-\fR<\fIinterface\fR> files. The first IP address
match is used, so if you have multiple interfaces, such a route may match
multiple IP addresses and cause unintended behavior.

In the latter case you may want to use the
.BI /etc/sysconfig/network/ifroute-\fR<\fIinterface\fR>
instead. Here an empty interface field is replaced with the interface name
that is currently being activated, that is the interface in the file name.

The
.B 5th, Options
column can be used to specify further options for the route like
\fBpreference\fR (metric), \fBmtu\fR or the \fBtype\fR of a route:
.TP
.B
unicast
The route entry describes real paths to the destinations covered by the route
prefix.
.TP
.B
local
The destinations are assigned to this host. The packets are looped back and
delivered locally.
.TP
.B
broadcast
The destinations are broadcast addresses. The packets are sent as link
broadcasts.
.TP
.B
multicast
A special type used for multicast routing. It is not present in normal routing
tables.
.TP
.B
throw
A special control route used together with policy rules. If such a route is
selected, lookup in this table is terminated pretending that no route was
found. Without policy routing it is equivalent to the absence of the route in
the routing table. The packets are dropped and the ICMP message
.I
net unreachable
is generated. The local senders get an ENETUNREACH error.
.TP
.B
unreachable
These destinations are unreachable. Packets are discarded and and the ICMP
message host unreachable is generated. The local senders get an EHOSTUNREACH error.
.TP
.B
prohibit
These destinations are unreachable. Packets are discarded and the ICMP message
.I
communication administratively prohibited
is generated. The local senders get an EACCES error.
.TP
.B
blackhole
These destinations are unreachable. Packets are discarded silently. The local
senders get an EINVAL error.
.TP
.B
nat
A special NAT route, not supported any longer since Linux 2.6.
.PP
All options (except of to, via and dev used in columns 1-4) of the
.B ip\ route\ add
command shall be supported.

Columns which are not needed should contain a dash sign (
.B -
) to ensure that the parser correctly interprets the command.

.fi

.PP
.B Note:
.br
Routes to directly connected network are created automatically
(Linux kernel 2.4 and later) as soon as the IP address is assigned
to the interface.

For example, when the eth0 interface IP addresses are 204.127.235.42/24
and 2001:DB8:100::42/64, the following routes are created automatically:
.nf
	204.127.235.0/24  -   -   eth0
	2001:DB8:100::/64 -   -   eth0
	fe80::/64         -   -   eth0
.fi
and should be omitted.
