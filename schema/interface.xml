     a callback-info dict is returned to wait for event providing the UP flag.

  <signal name="addressAcquired">
    <description>
     Emitted whenever an address was acquired through an addrconf service.

     Addrconf services like dhcp4 or dhcp6 are unable to grant a requested lease immediately.
     In response to a requestLease() call, they will return callback information containing
     a uuid, and the event name addressAcquired. Once the address negotiation with the DHCP
     server succeeds, wickedd will emit an addressAcquired event with the uuid specified in
     the callback info.

     If the DHCP supplicant is unable to obtain the requested lease, an addressDeferred is
     generated to trigger fallback actions and on final timeout addressLost instead.
    </description>
  </signal>
  <signal name="addressReleased">
    <description>
     Emitted whenever an address previously acquired through an addrconf service is released.

     Addrconf services like dhcp4 or dhcp6 should release their leases gracefully when the
     interface is taken down.
     In response to a dropLease() call, they will return callback information containing
     a uuid, and the event name addressReleased. Once the we have successfully informed
     the DHCP server and released the lease, wickedd will emit an addressReleased event with
     the uuid specified in the callback info.

     This signal is also emitted spontaneously when an addrconf service released a lease.
     For instance, if an interface is taken down manually using "ifconfig down", the DHCP
     supplicant will discard the lease it held for this interface, and subsequently,
     an addressReleased() event is emitted.
    </description>
  </signal>
  <signal name="addressDeferred">
    <description>
      Emitted whenever an addrconf service were unable to acquire lease inside the specified
      defer timeout to trigger fallback actions and addressLost on final acquire timeout.
    </description>
  </signal>
  <signal name="addressLost">
