<define name="network-address">
  <description>
   This is a network address of any support address family.
   On the wire, it is represented as uint16 containing the address family,
   followed by the raw address bytes in network byte order.

   In the XML representation, an unambiguous "natural" representation is used,
   e.g.  dotted quad for IPv4.

  <description>
   This is a network address in addr/prefix notation.
   On the wire, it is represented as uint16 containing the prefix length,
   followed by a uint16 containing the address family, and eventually
   the raw address bytes in network byte order.

   In the XML representation, an unambiguous "natural" representation is used,
   e.g.  dotted quad for IPv4, followed by a slash and the prefixlen.

  <description>
    This type can be used in a schema definition. It is used to "splice"
    the contents of a file as raw binary data into the configuration that
    is passed to the server.

    The purpose of this is to be able to keep things like cryptographic
    keys in a separate file.

  <description>
    On XML the data is in the format of `^([0-9a-f]{2})*$` and each two ascii

    It can be used to store opaque data in XML. The DBus end will get a
    byte-array.
