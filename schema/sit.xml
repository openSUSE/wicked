 <description>
   This link-layer service is provided by the SIT tunnel devices.

   SIT tunnels can be created through the org.opensuse.Network.SitTunnel.Factory
   factory interface.

   Note, that sit0 is automatically created at module load time and
   provides an automatic tunneling (use on your own risk). Deleting
   it, cause to delete all further tunnels (sit1, ...) that can be
   created for point-to-point tunnels. So just start with sit1.
