Presenting wicked network configuration
=======================================

This is the first public release of wicked, an experimental framework
for network configuration.

You may ask, don't we have enough of those already? Don't we have
NetworkManager, connman, netcf, and a few more?

The point I started from was the desire to unify what is usually provided
through the traditional ifup script kudzu, with some of the more desktop
oriented services provided by facilities like NetworkManager. I also
wanted to move towards a more powerful set of functionality written in
C, which is able to subsume functionality provided by ifconfig, ip(8),
brctl, vconfig, ethtool, etc, and be able to drive these through an
extensible XML representation of the network configuration.

Kind of the Grand Unified Theory of network configuration :-)

Right now, this implementation uses a daemon service and a command
line utility. The client and server communicate with each other over DBus.
For a conceptual overview of the supported DBus APIs, please refer
to the README and wicked(7).

After having hacked on this for a while, I want to release this to
the community for feedback.

If you're interested in finding out more, you will find a README
and several manpages in the source code, which is available from
https://github.com/openSÃœSE/wicked
