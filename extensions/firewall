# This extension scripts implements all supported interface operations
# related to firewalling.
#
# If you want to extend the functionality of this script, you first need
# the extend the schema file (firewall.xml) by adding new members to e.g. the
# fw-request types.
#
# If you want to implement additional methods, you can also add new
# <method> elements to the same schema file. However, in addition to that, you
# also need to add the necessary script actions to wicked's configuration
# file in /etc/wicked/config.xml, so that the daemon knows that it should call
# this extension script to handle these.
