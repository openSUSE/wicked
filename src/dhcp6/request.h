/*
 * -- prefix request
 *
 * RFC7550 describes handling of multiple IAs (NA + PD)
 * in a single session using one server (Section 4).
 * RFC8415 (Section 12.2) updates the original DHCPv6
 * RFC3315 and considers also multiple per-device IA-PDs
 * and collecting IA-NA/IA-PDs from multiple servers.
 *
 * Currently, we support getting one prefix for subnets
 * on other devices; requesting multiple (per-device)
 * prefixes maybe added later when we find an RFC8415
 * DHCPv6 server implementation.
 * Unlike IA structure, we use device name references
 * which are resolved into IAID from our IAID database.
